# sumsilverdragon-OOP_ManagementSystem_L2_ProjectI
This is a simple OOP management system, designed for Capstone Project I Level 2 of my Software Engineering bootcamp

#this program is Phase 1 of the Poised Management System Project, that:
    -creates a Project class and a Person class
    -creates one Project Object
    -creates 3 Person Objects
    -allows a user to input data to create these objects
    -and to edit the due date of a project, the total amount of the fee paid to date, update a contractor's contact details
    -finalise the project by printing an invoice for the outstanding fee
